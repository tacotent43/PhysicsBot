A Telegram bot designed to make studying physics more engaging and structured.

---

## Features (Current Implementation)

- **Topic navigation:** Users can explore physics sections and subsections based on the structure defined in `themes.json`.
- **Access to theory:** The bot sends PDF notes compiled from LaTeX files for the selected topic.
- **Problem sets:** Each topic provides access to related tasks. The bot shows the number of available problems from `tasks.json`. (Automatic task delivery and answer validation are in progress.)
- **Reference materials:** The bot can send a file with physical constants and tabular data.
- **User-friendly navigation:** Includes a "Back" button to easily return to the previous menu level.

## Technical Overview

### Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Framework:** [aiogram](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram) â€” asynchronous framework for Telegram bots
- **Data storage:** JSON files (`themes.json`, `scripts.json`, `config.json`, `tasks.json`)
- **Educational content:** PDF files compiled from `.tex` sources

### Architecture Summary

- At startup, the bot reads configuration and content structure from JSON files.
- A custom `state` module tracks each user's current path through the topic hierarchy and stores their answers.
- Message handlers process `/start`, `/choose`, `/constants`, and interpret regular text as menu selections.
- `get_by_path` enables dynamic access to the correct portion of `themes.json` based on user navigation.
- `send_file` handles PDF delivery of theory and constants.
- The `keyboards` module builds context-aware reply keyboards based on available options.

## Notes
* All theory materials are stored as LaTeX source files and compiled into PDFs.
* Tasks are organized per topic, with support for short image-based explanations.
* The bot is designed to be easily extended with new topics and problem sets.
